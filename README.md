Sales & Customer Dashboard (Tableau)

Built two interactive Tableau dashboards to analyze  sales and customer performance vs. previous year. The project highlights:

Sales & Profit Growth: Strong YoY increase in revenue, profit, and order quantity.

Product Insights: Some subcategories drive high profit, while others run at a loss.

Customer Insights: Growing customer base, but most are low-frequency buyers; a few key customers contribute heavily to profits.
